<p>When preparing datasets for training image classification models it's a real pain to manually sift through thousands of images to weed out the inaccurate, duplicate and broken ones. This cross-platform app aims to make the process a little more tolerable by allowing you to use keyboard shortcuts to quickly cycle through all the images in a folder and delete the ones you don't want.</p>

## Installation

First install the dependencies:

```
> yarn install or npm install
```

then build the executable:

```
> yarn package or npm run package
```

The resultant launch file can be found in the `release/build/*` folder e.g. on a mac it's `release/build/mac/ImageReviewer.app`. You can move this anywhere like to your desktop and run it as a standalone app going forward.

## Development

```
> yarn start or npm start
```

This will spin up a dev server which auto-reloads on file changes.

## Files

- Electron backend - `src/main/*`
- React frontend - `src/renderer/*`

## Usage

- <kbd>→</kbd> - next image
- <kbd>←</kbd> - prev image
- <kbd>Space</kbd> - delete image
- <kbd>CMD</kbd> / <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> - undo delete
- <kbd>a</kbd> - pick image (this moves the image into a subfolder called `_picked`)
- <kbd>CMD</kbd> / <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> - refresh the app
- click the "&#x21bb;" icon on the top right of the screen to reset history (visited folders whose contents were looped through at least once appear at a lower opacity for tracking purposes)
- &#9835; pop noise sounds each time a full loop completes when cycling through a directory

## Folder structure

This is a common folder structure for image classification datasets:

```
dog-breeds/
- doberman/
  - a.jpg
  - b.png
- german-shepherd/
  - c.jpg
  - d.webp
- miniature-poodle/
  - e.png
  - f.jpg
```

In other words you have a root folder with sub-folders for each _class_, and inside those sub-folders are the images. You can browse such a root folder using this app, same for individual folders with images.

Just make sure that the selected folder contains either **only images** or **only sub-folders**. This app isn't a full fledged file explorer and can't handle anything else at the moment.

## Roadmap

- Automate deleting duplicate images
- Automate deleting broken images
- Crop and keep only part of an image
- Convert all images to a particular format
